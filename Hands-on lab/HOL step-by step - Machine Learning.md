# Machine Learning hands-on lab step-by-step 

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will use Azure Databricks in combination with Azure Machine Learning to build, train and deploy desired models. You will learn how to train a forecasting model against time-series data, without any code, by using automated machine learning, and how to score data in real-time using Spark Structure Streaming within Azure Databricks.  You will create a recurrent neural network (RNN) model using PyTorch in Azure Databricks that can be used to forecast against time-series data and train a Natural Language Processing (NLP) text classification model using Keras. You will also learn how to use MLflow for managing experiments run directly on the Azure Databricks cluster and how MLflow can seamlessly log metrics and training artifacts in your Azure Machine Learning workspace.

At the end of this lab, you will improve your ability to build solutions leveraging Azure Machine Learning and Azure Databricks.

## Overview

Trey Research Inc. delivers innovative solutions for manufacturers. They specialize in identifying and solving problems for manufacturers that can run the range from automating away mundane but time-intensive processes to delivering cutting edge approaches that provide new opportunities for their manufacturing clients.

Trey Research is looking to provide the next generation experience for connected car manufacturers by enabling them to utilize AI to decide when to pro-actively reach out to the customer through alerts delivered directly to the car's in-dash information and entertainment head unit. For their proof of concept (PoC), they would like to focus on two maintenance related scenarios.

In the first scenario, Trey Research recently instituted new regulations defining what parts are compliant or out of compliance. Rather than rely on their technicians to assess compliance, they would like to automatically assess the compliance based on component notes already entered by authorized technicians. Specifically, they are looking to leverage Deep Learning technologies with Natural Language Processing techniques to scan through vehicle specification documents to find compliance issues with new regulations. Then each car is evaluated for out compliance components.

In the second scenario, Trey Research would like to predict the likelihood of battery failure based on the telemetry stream of time series data that the car provides about how the battery performs when the car is started, how it is charging while running and how well it is holding its charge, among other factors. If they detect a battery failure is imminent within the next 30 days, they would like to send an alert.

Upon detection of an out of compliance component or a battery at risk of failure, they would like to be able to send an alert directly to the customer inviting them to schedule a service appointment to replace the part.

In building this PoC, Trey Research wants to understand how they might use machine learning or deep learning in both scenarios, and standardize the platform that would support the data processing, model management and inferencing aspects of each.

They are also interested to learn what new capabilities Azure provides that might help them to integrate with their existing investments in MLflow for managing machine learning experiments. Furthermore, they would also like to understand how Azure might help them to document and explain the models that are created to non-data scientists or might accelerate their time to creating production ready, performant models.

In this lab, you will use Azure Databricks in combination with Azure Machine Learning to build, train and deploy the desired models.

## Solution architecture

The following diagram summarizes the key components and processing steps in the lab.

![Overall solution diagram, described in the text that follows.](images/lab-architecture.png 'Solution Architecture')

In this lab, models are trained using both Azure Databricks (for deep learning with the PyTorch and Keras frameworks) and Azure Machine Learning compute (for automated machine learning using the user experience in the Azure Machine Learning studio). Models are registered with the Azure Machine Learning Workspace. The data used for model training is read from Azure Storage.

The scoring is performed using notebooks running within Azure Databricks notebooks, which show how to load and apply the respective models against the data provided.

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

## Exercise 1: Creating a forecast model using automated machine learning

    ![Create a new dataset to be used by the automated ML run.](images/automl-create-dataset-01.png 'Create dataset for automated ML run')

5. In the `Basic info` section provide the following information and then select **Next**:

   - **Web URL**:
     ```
     https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/data/connected-car/daily-battery-time-series-v2.csv
     ```

   - **Name**: `daily-battery-time-series`

    ![Provide URL and name for the dataset in the basic info section.](images/automl-create-dataset-02a.png 'Basic info')

6. On the Settings and preview panel, set the **column headers** drop down to `All files have same headers`, and then select **Next**.

    ![Set the column headers property in the setting and preview panel.](images/automl-create-dataset-02b.png 'Settings and preview panel')

7. Review the training data schema. Toggle the `Include` switch next to the column name to exclude the `Path`, `Column1`, `Number_Of_Trips`, `Lifetime_Cycles_Used` and `Battery_Rated_Cycles` columns. Select **Next**.

    ![The schema section shows both selected and ignored features from the uploaded dataset.](images/automl-create-dataset-03.png 'Select Features')

8. Review the dataset details in the `Confirm details` section and select **Create**.

    ![Confirm the details of the dataset then select Create.](images/automl-create-dataset-04.png 'Confirm and create the dataset')

9. Select the `daily-battery-time-series` dataset and then select **Next**.

    ![Select the newly created dataset and continue the creation of the automated machine learning run](images/automl-create-dataset-05.png 'Select newly created dataset')

10. Provide the experiment name: `Battery-Cycles` and select `Daily_Cycles_Used` as target column. Select **Create a new compute**.

    ![The experiment name is "Battery-Cycles", the target column is "Daily_Cycles_Used", and "Create a new compute" button is highlighted.](images/automl-create-experiment.png 'Create New Experiment details')

11. For the new compute, provide the following values and then select **Create**:

    - Compute name: `auto-ml-compute`
    - Select Virtual Machine size: `STANDARD_DS11_v2`
    - Minimum number of nodes: `1`
    - Maximum number of nodes: `1`

    ![Create a New Compute dialog shows the values for various fields, such as Compute name.](images/automl-create-compute.png 'Create a New Compute')

    The creation of the new compute may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, select **Next** in the `Configure run` section.

12. Select the `Time series forecasting` task type and then select `Date` as the time column and `Battery_ID` as group by column. Select **View additional configuration settings**.

    ![Configure the automated machine learning task type as a time series forecasting task with "Date" as the time column and "Battery_ID" as group by column.](images/automl-configure-task-01.png 'Configure time series forecasting task')

13. For the automated machine learning run additional configurations, provide the following values and then select **Save**:

    - Primary metric: `Normalized root mean squared error`

    - Forecast Horizon: enter `30`. This refers to forecasting out up to 30 days.

    - Training job time (hours) (in the `Exit criterion` section): enter `1`. This is the lowest value currently accepted.

    - Metric score threshold: enter `0.1355`. When this threshold value will be reached for an iteration metric the training job will terminate.

    ![The automated machine learning run additional configurations dialog shows values for various fields such as "Primary metric", "Forecast horizon" etc...](images/automl-configure-task-02.png 'Configure automated machine learning run additional configurations')

    *Note that we are setting a metric score threshold to limit the training time. In practice, for initial experiments, you will typically only set the training job time to allow AutoML to discover the best algorithm to use for your specific data.*

14. Select **Finish** to start the new automated machine learning run.

    > **Note**: The experiment should run for up to 10 minutes. If the run time exceeds 15 minutes, cancel the run and start a new one (steps 3, 9, 10, 12, 13, and 14). Make sure you provide a lower value for `Metric score threshold` in step 13.

### Task 2: Review the experiment run results

1. Once the experiment completes, select `Details` to examine the details of the run containing information about the recommended model and the run summary.

   ![Run details shows recommended model and run summary.](images/automl-review-run-01.png 'Run details - recommended model and summary')

2. Select `Models` to see a table view of different iterations and the `Normalized root mean squared error` score for each iteration. Note that the normalized root mean square error measures the error between the predicted value and actual value. In this case, the model with the lowest normalized root mean square error is the best model. Note that Azure Machine Learning Python SDK updates over time and gives you the best performing model at the time you run the experiment. Thus, it is possible that the best model you observe can be different than the one shown below.

    ![Run models shows a table view of iteration details and corresponding primary metric values.](images/automl-review-run-02.png 'Run Details - Models with their associated primary metric values')

3. Return to the details of your experiment run and select **View model details**.

    ![Run details shows recommended model and run summary.](images/automl-review-run-03.png 'Run details - recommended model and summary')

4. Review the various **Run Metrics** to evaluate the model performance.

    ![Model details show model performance on various evaluation metrics.](images/automl-review-run-04.png 'Model details - Run Metrics')

5. Next, select **Visualizations** to review the model performance curve: `Predicted vs True`. When you are done, select **Run Detail** to return to the details of your experiment.

    ![Visualizations section showing Predicted vs True curve.](images/automl-review-run-05.png 'Predicted vs True curve')

### Task 3: Deploy the Best Model

1. From the details section, select **Deploy best model**.

    ![The "Deploy best model" for an automated machine learning experiment run.](images/automl-deploy-best-model-01.png 'Deploy best model')

2. Provide the `Name`, `Description` and `Compute type`, and then select **Deploy**:

    - Name: **battery-cycles**

    - Description: **The best AutoML model to predict battery cycles.**

    - Compute type: Select `ACI`.

    ![The Deploy a model dialog that shows values name, description, and compute type.](images/automl-deploy-best-model-02.png 'Deploy the best model')

3. The model deployment process will register the model, create the deployment image, and deploy it as a scoring webservice in an Azure Container Instance (ACI). To view the deployed model, from Azure Machine Learning studio select **Endpoints icon, Real-time endpoints**.

   ![Viewing the list of deployed model endpoints in the Azure Machine Learning workspace](images/automl-deploy-best-model-03.png 'Deployed model endpoints')

   > **Note**: The `battery-cycles` endpoint will show up in a matter of seconds but the actual deployment takes several minutes. You can check the deployment state of the endpoint by selecting it and then selecting the `Details` tab. A successful de deployment will have a state of `Healthy`.

4. If you see your model deployed in the above list, you are now ready to continue on to the next exercise.
